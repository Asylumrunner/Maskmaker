# Maskmaker
A Node.js API for generating non-player characters for tabletop role-playing games

## Overview
I run a number of tabletop RPGs for a variety of groups, and one of the hardest parts for me is coming up with distinct personalities for non-player characters on the spot. So, I decided to write myself an application that could automatically generate NPCs, at least in the broad strokes, on my behalf.

This API is built to be relatively bare-bones on its own. By default, you provide a *number* path parameter which will determine how many NPCs are generated. Optionally, a json body can be passed detailing custom attributes to use when defining character stats (a default is available, which is the classic D&D six stats of Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma). The API will use either the custom attributes or the default when generating.

There are two primary consumers I plan to build for this application. The first is a Discord bot which will consume this API and use it to generate NPCs on the fly for a GM of an online tabletop game. The second application is a consumer which will take the output of this API and convert it into CSV tables which can be used with an application called [CardMaker](https://github.com/nhmkdev/cardmaker), which can take csvs and turn them into printable card sheets. This is useful for physical play sessions, in which I'd like to have a "deck" of NPCs ready to go, but would prefer to not be shackled to electronics while I play.

## Conversion
This project was originally written in Python 3.6, but as a learning exercise, Maskmaker is a conversion of that original project to NodeJS.

## How It Works
Characters generated by this application have three primary components. The first is a name, randomly selected from a list generated by hitting the random name API provided by [http://uinames.com](http://uinames.com). These names are originally given in their native alphabet, so Node's unidecode package is used to convert them to printable English, a method that still produces some occasional bugs but is generally successful.

Characters also have a set of three personality traits randomly assigned to them. These are pulled from a list of character traits randomly, such that no trait is shared between characters.

The last aspect of a character are approximate statistical attributes. Most RPGs use some sort of numerical system to represent characters' attributes, but using any of those systems in this application would limit its usefulness. Instead, the user may enter the set of attributes they want to use, or use the default D&D stats. Then, the application will go through every attribute for every character, and decide if the character is, in that stat, pathetically inept, lower than average, average, better than average, or exceptional. The numbers are weighted such that average score are more likely than non-average scores.

## Additional Scope
An additional payload feature I would like to include is the ability to provide either a regional preference for the names generated (uinames actually has this feature available), or to provide a list of names at the outset that can be pulled from.

What would be really *really* cool is the ability to provide a reasonably large set of example names and have the API generate a Markov Chain based on them, allowing it to generate unique names conforming to a standard defined by the user. To circumvent repeat calculation, I would probably allow users to, if they so choose, save their name set to a database, or more specifically the Markov Chain modeling their name set, and allow it to be retrieved, such that it doesn't need to be recalculated.

## To-Do List
* Store Markov Chains in a database because dear god those things are hideously ugly to manipulate
* Implement database wiper
* Implement tests
* Convert API to run in AWS Lambda
* Deploy application to Lambda
